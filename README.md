# Lunar Sentinel Unity Game
A simple arcade-style game which is based on Atari's **Missile Command** with a pixel art style theme  
In this game you control two robots and shoot down incoming meteors before they hit the structures or the robots themselves  

**Do note that bullets are *supposed* to go through the meteors - this is an intended game design**  
In the original Missile Command, the idea is to predict where missiles will be, not shoot them directly

## Main Features
- A wave-based system that gets harder over time (balancing mostly consists of me going "um, that seems fair" and moving on)
- Different types of powerups
- Local leaderboard system
- Sound effects

## Controls
- **Left click** to shoot
- Esc to pause
- P for powerups

## Download
You can download it through the [releases tab](https://github.com/LeapInui/lunar-sentinel/)  
Just download it, unzip it, and run the exectuable - you may get a windows defender popup since the build isn't signed however the game is safe to run!  
Should work out of the box (tested on Windows)
